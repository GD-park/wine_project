# wine_project
- Recommend wine which you like
- work with Bae-Junyang, Noh-SangHo, Kim-Unyoung, Park-JiYong

## Work Flow
- Data Preprocessing : Get Data from Wine21.com(http://www.wine21.com)
- Feature Selection : We decide to select location1, type, variety, sweet, body, Testingnote
- Modeling : Using Euclidean Distance & Cosine Similarity
- Validation : we contact from Sommelier who got world wine certification and get feedback from him

## Limitaion
Because we choose the product based recommend system, It's very hard to validation. However we try to contact more than 100 sommelier for validation, luckily we can contact famous Sommelier.

If you see the summary.ipynb, you can see the all of our project flow & code.
